He is the Chinese equivalent of Thucydide, the author of “History of the Peloponnesian War”, or Suetonius, the author of “The Twelve Caesars”. Sima Qian is the author of “Shizi”, also sometimes called “The Scribe’s Notes”. It is a historic document covering more than 2,000 years of Chinese history. It is one of the only Chinese publications to provide details on the victory of the Qin kingdom, the reign and personality of the First Emperor and on his death and the end of his dynasty. Today’s historians suspect Sima Qian to not have been completely objective in his description of the Qin. Indeed, Sima Qian was the subject of a Han emperor from the dynasty that succeeded the Qin. Moreover, he had every interest in painting a bleak picture of Shi Huangdi, described as an arrogant and obstinate despot obsessed with his glory. However, we owe him the unique detailed description of the First Emperor’s tomb which is within the Necropolis and was rediscovered in 1974. There is no mention of the Terracotta Army in his writings, so it is possible he did not know of its existence or did not consider it relevant or noteworthy. Although Sima Qian may not have always been objective, the modern archaeological excavations give credence to his description of the tomb.

Most researchers agree that the construction work was carried out on a much greater scale than expected and accelerated after the proclamation of the empire in 221 BC. Several elements that allow us to date certain phases of the Terracotta Army’s creation could confirm this theory. For example, certain wood that was used as pit props, like Pine, came from the state of Chu, the actual Sichuan province, even though the state of Chu was only conquered by the Qin in 223 BC. Other researchers are, however, leaning towards a much earlier start of the construction work as early as 228 BC beginning with the layout of the pits. They note that the wood was not only from the Chu region but, according to available stocks, was also from many parts of the empire. The seals affixed by the workshop foremen on some of the weapons recovered in the pits could support this claim: these weapons were made from 245 BC to 228 BC.

During this last phase, entrusted to the potters, the statues (particularly the face details) were individually shaped by hand. The craftsmen used several tricks: they modified the facial expressions, moustaches, eyebrows and ears. They would make incisions in the loose clay to give an impression of texture, especially on the headdresses. Also, they would change the angles of the arms as well as the positions of the hands and fingers according to the warrior’s role. Indeed, whether he was an infantryman, an archer or a charioteer, the hand position would change. The statues’ wide variety of facial expressions was also reinforced after the baking was complete and this was done when the statues were painted, particularly the details on their clothing and faces.

Other statue elements have been found below 200 meters, in the southeast corner of Pit #1, which indicates the possible presence of an oven in that particular area.

Baking statues of such large proportions (up to 1.9m) must have included several failed attempts.

They main weapons found were crossbow triggers and arrowheads, which are massively spread on the sides and at the front of the Terracotta Army of that same pit. Certain weapons were marked with a seal indicating the name of the craftsman who made it, the location of his workshop and, in some cases, the production date. They are said to range from 245 to 228 BC. During the reign of the First Emperor, 90% of weapons were made out of bronze whereas, in Europe, iron had already been used for centuries. Even if iron weapons were much sharper than bronze weapons, they were less solid. 10% of the iron weapons are considered to have only had a ceremonial use. As the Chinese armorers had mastered bronze production techniques, they were capable of producing, at an almost industrial scale, weapons of high quality.

In China, the first traces of horses being used as draft horses, whether for agriculture or war, date back to the Shang dynasty, around 1350 BC. For centuries, wars were led by armies solely composed of chariots. The strength of an army was evaluated according to the number of chariots it had. Ever since the end of the 4th century BC, the Chinese, inspired by the nomads, introduced the use of cavalry. Cavalry troops became more and more popular in comparison with armies containing chariots. The cavalry could more easily be manipulated on more rugged and swamped soils, where chariots were more likely to get stuck in the mud, break or flip over. Thus, the role of chariots diminished during the reign of the First Emperor. Despite this, they continued to play a fundamental role: the officers that were installed in them controlled the infantry and cavalry on the battlefields. The chariots that were placed with the infantry carried an officer who commanded 70 to 75 infantrymen. Some 130 chariots were found in the necropolis. Compared to those from previous periods, those of the First Emperor possess an important improvement: the wheels are much smaller and have more spokes, which reinforces the carriage’s solidity and stability."),

They showed which movements the troops had to reproduce in battles and made the spotting of their officer on the battlefield a lot easier. Each army officer had their own flag in order to be easily identifiable. Long weapons and carriages were also decorated with smaller flags. The use of audio techniques was of an urgent need: the warriors did not always have a clear view towards their flag during battles. Drums simply indicated the forward movements and attacks while bells announced the troops’ retreat and redeployment."),

It took no less than eight years of careful restoration to return them their former shape and shine. Today, these constitute, undoubtedly, the most exceptional pieces of the necropolis: the chariots, horses and drivers are all entirely made out of bronze whereas the horse adornments are embellished with gold and silver. Both chariots are composed of 3,000 detachable pieces. About a dozen different procedures were used to make them: molding, incrustation, riveting, snapping buttons, amongst others. The predominant color of both of the carriages is white. The color of the carriage carries symbolism. Indeed, during the Qin dynasty, the colors red, black, grey and white symbolized the Southern, Northern, Central and Western regions of China.

Better yet, the necropolis represents the universe which gravitates around the Emperor himself, as Shi Huangdi had the ambition of being a cosmic ruler.

In the west, there is a segment of 186 meters, linked to the first. This system was conceived to prevent floods during the construction work.

Archaeologists think that the funeral chamber actually measures 80 meters long (east-west axis), 50 meters wide (north-south axis) and 15 meters high. Based on the tombs discovered of other Chinese leaders, we can strongly presume that the First Emperor’s tomb also has several rooms linked to each other.

Judging by presence of bronze and jade objects around them, as well as the quality of the coffins and sarcophagus, they are undoubtedly figures of higher ranks.

Waiting for the development of more advanced excavation and preservation techniques is often cited as the principal reason for it, but it isn’t the only one. Wu Yongqi, director of the Chinese Terracotta Army museum, gave the following explanation in 2007: “We must not dig the funeral complex in an indiscriminate manner, particularly in the emperor’s tomb. We must respect our ancestors and cultural heritage and, whatever measures we take, we must not destroy the remains of the relics and sites. Our aim must be to gradually compile historical facts”. Beyond the scientific arguments made by researchers in view of the inheritance preservation, the reticence of the Chinese authorities to access the tomb can also be explained by spiritual reasons. The constant evolution of technology allows us, however, to remain positive. In 2012, the Chinese authorities unveiled the scans of the Qing dynasty tombs (1644-1911), made by scientists from three Scottish institutions. Based on a technology that uses lasers and 360° photos, these scans allow us to have a 3D image of the studied zones. Even better, they allow us to have a better insight of the construction methods which were used and have allowed the deciphering of certain inscriptions on some objects.

The trims of these scales all have an ornamental pattern. The middle-rank officers had a breastplate that either protected their back or chest, or only their chest. Certain armors sometimes covered the shoulders. The types of ornamentation and assembling techniques were similar to those used for the armors of the generals. The armors of the charioteers were much longer than the one described above: they also protected the hands and arms. However, the horsemen, for their part, only had their upper body protected. Also, some infantrymen, mainly those at the forefront, wore no armor at all, only robes. To this day, no complete shield or war helmet has been found in the pits of the Terracotta Army. Yet, they were often used on the battlefield. This lack of protection could be explained based on two assumptions: it could reflect the courage and audacity of the Emperor’s warriors or it could reflect that the army is not represented in an order of battle but in anticipation of orders, without the hindrance of heavy equipment. The remnants of a wooden shield were found near a chariot, in 2009. The outside dimensions were 70 by 50 centimeters.
